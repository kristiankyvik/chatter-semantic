# Chatter, using Semantic-UI
---

## WARNING: Pre-Alpha state, bugs and missing functionality everywhere!

This is the Semantic UI package for the chatter-core package. This is a **bring-your-own-css** package, meaning you need to bring a flavor of Semantic UI with you, like the semantic:ui-css package.

Chatter has the ambition of becoming an easy to set up in-app chat package that requires minimal configuration to run, yet can be heavily customized to fit your needs should you wish. The current state of in-app chat felt lacking, hence this project was born. I will be using this in my own production apps, so it will not be going away in the near future.
